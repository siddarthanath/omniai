OmniAI provides implementations of foundational AI algorithms from first principles. Built for learning, understanding, and mastering the core concepts of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

## üåü Architecture Overview

This repository implements AI algorithms from ground up, focusing on both theoretical foundations and practical implementations. The codebase follows familiar scikit-learn and PyTorch patterns while exposing the underlying mechanics.

## üéØ Core Objectives

### Educational Foundation
- Master mathematical foundations through probabilistic and calculus-based approaches
- Understand gradient descent mechanics beyond `.fit()`
- Implement backpropagation from first principles
- Explore probabilistic models (Naive Bayes, GMMs) at a fundamental level

### Technical Mastery
- Debug complex models through deep understanding of internals
- Optimize implementations for specific use cases
- Identify and resolve performance bottlenecks
- Make informed architectural decisions

### Engineering Excellence
- Understand core algorithms at implementation level
- Master mathematical foundations behind each approach
- Learn model limitations and assumptions
- Develop robust debugging strategies

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Philosophy

While powerful libraries like scikit-learn, PyTorch, and TensorFlow exist, implementing from scratch provides:
- Deep understanding of hyperparameter impacts
- Intuition for algorithm selection
- Recognition of model constraints
- Clear architectural decision-making capability

Most of the implementations will take a blend of scikit-learn and PyTorch form.
## üßÆ Mathematical Approaches

### Probabilistic Methods
- Foundation: Bayes' Theorem and probability theory
- Implementations:
 - Naive Bayes using P(y|X)
 - Gaussian Mixture Models
 - Hidden Markov Models

### Optimisation Methods
- Foundation: Calculus and gradient descent
- Implementations:
 - Linear Regression with MSE optimisation
 - Neural Networks with backpropagation
 - Support Vector Machines with margin maximisation

We will also aim to demonstrate the connection between these two approaches in order to build
a unified interface.
